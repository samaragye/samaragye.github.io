      <p><font color="#6F4E37">Originating from Italy, a macaroon is a cookie made from egg whites, sugar, and nuts (coconuts, almonds, etc). Macaroons are easy to make and can be done in less than one hour. A macaroon is pronounced as mack-a-rue-n. </font></p>

      <h2>Whole Grain Bread vs Whole Wheat Bread</h2>
      <h3><a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/multigrain-bread/" target="_blank">Whole Grain Bread</a></h3><img src="https://openverse.org/image/2ab2a349-af0b-4c7a-a70f-6ec7dc6846e5?q=grain+bread" alt="whole grain bread" "height="400" width="500/>

      <p><font color="#6F4E37"><font color="#6F4E37">Made with a mixture of urefined grains (wheat, corn, rice, and more), whole grain bread preserves all parts of a kernel of the grain, allowing the bread to be rich in fiber and nutrients, like iron and potassium. This bread is more healthier than whole wheat and multigrain bread (which containes refined grains, removing a significant amount of the nutrients and fiber from the bread).</p>
      <h3><a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/whole-wheat-bread/" target="_blank">Whole Wheat Bread</a></h3><img src="https://openverse.org/image/e8bb3cf4-3ce3-4a26-b7e3-869c4a074af3?q=whole+wheat+bread" alt="whole wheat bread" "height="400" width="500/>

      <p><font color="#6F4E37"><font color="#6F4E37">Being a type of whole grain bread, whole wheat bread is comprised of just wheat, rather than a mixture of other grains. While whole wheat bread is rich in fiber and nutrients, whole grain is considered healthier as it has a variety of grains, allowing the bread to be more packed with nutrients. </font></p>
