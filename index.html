      <p><font color="#6F4E37"><font color="#6F4E37">Made with a mixture of urefined grains (wheat, corn, rice, and more), whole grain bread preserves all parts of a kernel of the grain, allowing the bread to be rich in fiber and nutrients, like iron and potassium. This bread is more healthier than whole wheat and multigrain bread (which containes refined grains, removing a significant amount of the nutrients and fiber from the bread).</p>
      <h3><a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/whole-wheat-bread/" target="_blank">Whole Wheat Bread</a></h3>

      <h5>"whole wheat bread" by Stacy Spensley is licensed under CC BY 2.0.</h5>
      <p><font color="#6F4E37"><font color="#6F4E37">Being a type of whole grain bread, whole wheat bread is comprised of just wheat, rather than a mixture of other grains. While whole wheat bread is rich in fiber and nutrients, whole grain is considered healthier as it has a variety of grains, allowing the bread to be more packed with nutrients. </font></p>
